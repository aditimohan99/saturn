            <p>A university student in the Philippines invented a device that turns rotten fruit and vegetables into renewable energy.

                Carvey Maigue’s invention uses upcycled crop waste to absorb stray UV light from the sun and convert it to electricity. Here’s how it works: Particles from fruits and veggies are suspended in resin, and when hit by sunlight the particles absorb and emit light. When captured, this light can be converted into electricity.
                
                It’s the same technology that derived from the phenomena creating the Northern lights: Luminescent particles absorb high-energy particles and re-remit them as light.
                
                Maigue’s invention was the first-ever sustainability winner for the James Dyson Award, a competition for creating a design that solves a problem. His design is among 1,800 entries from young inventors and design engineers from 27 countries around the world.
                
                "This year has brought massive challenges, and if one thing is certain, our top 20 inventors have shown that young minds and unfiltered curiosity need a seat at the table," Dyson global director of sustainability Tom Crawford said. "There is always a need to solve problems, and the number and breadth of this year’s entries show that the future of invention is bright.
